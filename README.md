## Hi there!

I am a 4th year computer science student at the University of Florida! I love to work on projects and I've got a variety that go into front-end, back-end, and some machine learning aspects as well. I am currently working on building out my own servers on [deguzman.cloud](https://deguzman.cloud) :D
